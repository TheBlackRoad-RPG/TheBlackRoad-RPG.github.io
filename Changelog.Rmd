<!-- # Foreword -->

<!-- > Soon^tm -->

# Save/Load System

> Transitioned to a codeless save/load system. Hence, we have updated the save/load directory to "v1.39". You can still load your old 1.38d2 codes to convert them to the 1.39 system.

- Saving will always write your save code to a file named `_lastsave.txt`
- You can save to a different file per usual by specifying the name of the file, like in 1.38d2. For example, `-s intranger` would save to `intranger.txt`, and `_lastsave.txt`. If you do not specify a name, it instead save to `<class name>.txt` and `_lastsave.txt`
- `-l` and `-load` will default to loading the code stored in `_lastsave.txt`. If you want to load from a specific file, you must include it in the command. For example `-l ranger` will load the code in `ranger.txt`

---

- Player names with special or accented characters can now create valid codes
- Hero and bank are now included in a single save code
- You can save up to 250,000 crafting materials (previously 237,000)
- Addressed the legacy bug of Soul-Piercing Shot and Mark of Artemis being auto-levelled
- Now saves the amount of experience your hero has, rather than the hero level
- Updated the information embedded within the save code file
  + Class, Hero Level, XP, Stats, and Spell Levels
  + Profession, Profession Level, Gold and Crafting Materials
  + Items in your hero's and bank's inventories

### Chronowave (Active Form):

> A second after the boulders drop, **Sphinx** will begin to channel **Chronowave**. Once **Sphinx** starts channelling it, she cannot be interrupted. After 3 seconds, a force field expands from **Sphinx**'s current origin which damages units caught by it for 15000 magical damage, as well as applying *Stifle III* and *Hinder III* on them for 5 seconds. However, if **Chronowave** hits a boulder, it is destroyed and grants nearby units protection from **Chronowave**. Once **Chronowave** expands, **Sphinx** cannot make any further actions for the next 5 seconds.

### Entomb (Active Form):

> **Sphinx** entombs a random hero after recovering from channelling **Chronowave**. The tomb prevents the target from naturally moving out of it and takes 15 hits to be destroyed. However, the entombed hero dies after 10 seconds without being freed. **Sphinx** heals herself for 20% of the entombed hero's current health and spawns a **Fallen Hero**.

### Transition to Passive Form (Active Form):

> If **Sphinx** drops below 50% HP, the next **Chronowave** launched transitions her to *Passive Form*, and summons the **Twinblades**. She cannot attack nor cast any of her *Active Form* spells. She remains in *Passive Form* for about next 300 seconds.

### Timeless Body (Passive Form):

### Vengeful Gaze (Passive Form):

### Meteor (Post-Passive Form): 

> After **Timeless Body**, casts **Meteor** instead of **Boulderfall & Chronowave**. Then, every third **Boulderfall & Chronowave** is replaced with **Meteor**. **Sphinx** channels **Meteor** to a random location within a 200-600 range for 3 seconds. On impact, **Meteor** deals 5000 + *X* physical damage to all enemies within a 400 AoE and 5000 + *Y* physical damage to all enemies inside the **Barbaric Plains**. *X* = 10000 / *N*, where *N* is the number of enemies within 400 units of Meteor. *Y* = 5000 if *N* > 0,  otherwise *Y* = 10000.
