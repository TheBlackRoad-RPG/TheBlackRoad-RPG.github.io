## General

-   Adding the `-craftkey`/`-ck` chat command. This changes the crafting

-   The model for *Obelisk of Poseidon* has been updated.
-   *Teleport to the Obelisk of Poseidon* no longer requires a *Teleport
    Stone*.

    Poseidon* at map start.
-   Updated *Enfeeble*'s (Generic Debuff) FX and icon.
-   *Statuette of the Tych*e now has a passive which lists the Essence
    exchange rates for *Olympian Gemstone Fragments* and the *Gemstone
    of the Olympians*.
-   Redefined a notch of *The Fools' Mausoleum* zone to prevent a bug
    where triggered movement, e.g. *Winds of War*, can cause a hero to
    enter it from the *Minotaur Burrows*.
