## General

The maximum number of attribute points depended on the hero level. ⇒ The
maximum number of attribute points is 3500 for all levels.

The number of attribute points granted per level depended on the hero
level ⇒ Eight attribute points granted per level.

You gain approximately 90 more attribute points from Level 1 to Level
200.

Statuette of Tyche can now Retrain all Strength attribute points,
Retrain all Agility attribute points, and Retrain all Intelligence
attribute points.

Cost: 100 Essence

Set Strength/Agility/Intelligence to 1. Grant attribute points equal to
the amount lost by setting your attribute(s) to 1.

Warrior classes cannot Retrain all Intelligence attribute points.

The -kill chat command has been removed.

The -disarm chat command now only applies to crafting components &
generic quest items. This functions behaves like the functionality when
a player leaves a game, but doesn't drop the items in town.

Updated two components of how TBR's stun is coded and specified

It might be downstream bug fix for the TBR's stun being dispelled on
application

The DPS Dummy now has a preconfigured template to replicate Persephone's
defensive stats

Book of Skill Increase/Reset, DPS Dummy, Forge Regalia, and Familiar
Passive custom UI is now locked to a fixed scale

Properly anchored the Essence tooltips, Resist tooltip, and Personal
Quest UI to be scaleable.

Enabling "Always Visible" in lobby creation options no longer end the
lobby and insteads reinstates fog of war (as if the terrain was
explored)

The lobby description now states the Discord invite link

The triggered damage reduction formulas for Armor and Resist now returns
a fixed value for damage amplication for values less than and equal to
-20 (as per base Wc3 mechanics)

Nereid now render correctly in the DPS UI

Aphrodite's Blessed Orb no longer grants the Mana Regeneration V item

Poison Blade now works with other enhanced auto-attack abilities

Poison Blade's damage-over-time debuff now lasts for 10 seconds as
intended

(Personal Quest), you no longer re-discover Heletes' Ingenuity
