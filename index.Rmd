# Bug Fixes

<!-- General -->
<!-- - Backpack have been renamed into Familiar -->
<!-- - Updated the boat replacement system to handle two concurrent boats. (This also means that the refund functionality has been removed) -->
<!-- - Olympian Gemstone Shards (Hyperion) now state the amount of charges in the generated save-code file -->
<!-- - Thundering Hammer of Zeus and Savage War Axe of Hephaestus are now simultaneously equippable under the current item uniqueness framework. See Bug Fixes for the reason why this occurred -->
<!-- - The Fire Elemental summon from the Blaze o' Glory item ability (Midas' Pendant of Wisdom) now has a mana pool which reflects it's duration -->
<!-- - The Roar item ability on Ares' Bloodthirsty Spear (Olympian Relic) now features a unique icon to indicate that it doesn't stack with Scroll of the Lesser Beast and Scroll of the Beast (Alchemy) -->
<!-- - Added a section on item uniqueness to the TBR Mechanics F9 entry -->

<!-- Heroes -->
<!-- - Updated the Spartan Warrior model -->
<!-- - Valor (Spartan Warrior) -->
<!-- ~ Mana cost increased to 25 / 75 / 160 / 250 / 340 / 425 / 515 / 600 (previously 25 / 50 / 85 / 140 / 210 / 300 / 405 / 525) -->
<!-- ~ AoE decreased to 300 (from 600) -->
<!-- ~ Restores 1.0 Strength + 0.15 / 0.2 / 0.25 / 0.3 / 0.35 / 0.45 / 0.55 / 0.65 Spell Healing over the duration -->
<!-- ~ No longer grants an armor bonus for the duration -->
<!-- ~ Duration decreased to 3 seconds (from 12 seconds) -->
<!-- ~ Cooldown decreased to 12 seconds (from 30 seconds) -->

<!-- Sedah Scarecrow (DPS Dummy) -->
<!-- The Sedah Scarecrow has been overhauled for DPS feedback purposes. It is no longer hostile by default and requires you to manually activate it by "purchasing" a token within 1000 units of it. Upon purchase, it becomes hostile and an user interface pops-up above the command card which details: -->
<!-- (1) Hero Information -->
<!-- (2) DPS calculations for Total, Physical, and Magical DPS. The calculation for DPS uses an average (mean) updated every second -->
<!-- (3) Misc. Statistics -->
<!-- (4) Ability to adjust the durability of the Sedah Scarecrow -->
<!-- (5) Buttons to configure the Sedah Scarecrow to Hades, Hyperion, and No Resistances durabilities -->
<!-- (6) Features a Close and Reset Timer button -->

<!-- The user interface tracks only tracks the damage you've dealt to it and it doesn't start timing until it takes damage from you. Lastly, the user interface automatically closes if you are no longer within 1000 units of it. -->

<!-- We've removed the Noirepyh Scarecrow as the functionality of having two scarecrows has been superseded. -->

<!-- Bug Fixes -->
<!-- - Transcendence (Cleric) auto-attacks on the DPS dummy now properly calculates the heal -->
<!-- - Adamantium Scythe (Medusa) tooltip correctly states that it has a critical strike multiplier of 2.5 times -->
<!-- - Assassinate (Assassin), Bum Rush (Warlord) and Charge (Spartan Warrior) path-finding has been updated to mimic pre-1.39b3 behaviour and attempts to find better placement options than before. It also has a better failsafe of simply closing the distance if a pathable spot cannot be found. Furthermore, all three spells now share the same trait that Assassinate (and previously Charge) has where the blink doesn't occur if you're within 125 units of the target -->
<!-- - The item uniqueness check non longer prints an error message no longer prints error messages when a familiar picks up a unique item. This is because item uniqueness is only enforced for heroes -->
<!-- - Picking up Savage War Axe of Hephaestus (Aeacus) no longer triggers the Thundering Hammer of Zeus (Olympian Relic) item uniqueness error message when you already have Hephaestus Thundering Axe (Weaponsmith) -->
<!-- - Picking up Warrior class exclusive items now states that Khaos Champion is a Warrior class hero -->
<!-- - Midas' Pendant of Wisdom's (Metalsmith Galen) Enfeeble proc for spell damage is functional again -->
<!-- - Updated spawn regions in the Tundra and Southern Highlands to address mobs spawning on cliff faces -->
<!-- - The save/load system now correctly encrypts and decrypts the value stored for the You picked the wrong house, fool achievement -->
<!-- - Fixed typos in F9 help and Gift of Wisdom (Familiar Skill) -->

<!-- Heroes -->
<!-- - The Spartan Warrior soundset is changed to Garithos (from Arthas with Forstmourne) -->
<!-- - Updated the icon for Spartan Warrior -->
<!-- - Embolden (Guardian of Nature) ~ replaces Roar -->
<!-- ~ Grants 0.15 / 0.175 / 0.2 / 0.225 / 0.25 / 0.275 / 0.3 / 0.325 Strength + 0.3 / 0.35 / 0.4 / 0.45 / 0.5 / 0.55 / 0.6 / 0.65 Intelligence bonus damage for the duration -->
<!-- ~ No longer grants bonus armor for the duration -->
<!-- ~ AoE: 600 -->
<!-- ~ Mana cost: 50 / 75 / 100 / 150 / 225 / 300 / 450 / 600 -->
<!-- ~ Duration: 6 seconds -->
<!-- ~ Cooldown: 15 seconds -->

<!-- Bug Fixes -->
<!-- - Dancing Dagger (Assassin) no longer bounces to structures -->
<!-- - Added a failsafe for Uranus' item drops if neither the ground or air forms are currently in the arena -->
<!-- - Updated the code for Winds of War (Warlord), Chronowave (Sphinx), Thunderbolt (Druid), Maelstrom (Druid), and Death Wave (Warlock) to not depend on the same code that can cause the the grouping bug (for the time being) -->

<!-- Other -->
<!-- - Reformatted Aphrodite's Favour (Goldsmith)  item tooltip to read like Midas' Ring of Vigor -->
<!-- - Defeating Hades now cleans up all Ker adds -->

<!-- Heroes -->
<!-- - Impale (Warlord): Agility modifier reduced to 5.0 (from 6.0). -->
<!-- - Grave Seize (Khaos Champion): Strength modifier increased to 2.0 (from 1.0). -->

<!-- Adjustments to Sedah Scarecrow -->
<!-- - The Boss Template buttons now fire on-click -->
<!-- - Single-clicks for the  - and + buttons now fire on-release -->
<!-- - Holding the - and + buttons for at least one second begins decrementing / incrementing the Scarecrow's armor or resist by steps of 10 per second -->
<!-- - The Armor Type buttons now have a highlight effect when hovering over them -->
<!-- - [Bug Fix] Abilities such as Hallowed Ground now work on Sedah Scarecrow again -->
<!-- - The auto-close functionality when you're too far away from Sedah Scarecrow now runs as you open the UI -->

<!-- Other -->
<!-- - The level requirement for a bank has been reduced to 60 (from 85). -->
<!-- - A number of UI buttons now happen on-click rather than on-release as a side effect of addressing an UI bug. See #Bug-Fixes for more details -->
<!-- - Addressed a typo in Draught of the Phoenix's (Alchemist) crafting description -->
<!-- - Improved the language of Dispatch's (Spartan Warrior) tooltip to be more explicit that it is Spell Damage and Strength that contributes to the damage. -->
<!-- - The Hero Selection heroes now register 0 damage from all sources. -->

<!-- Bug Fixes -->
<!-- - Applying Ensnare to an already Ensnared unit now correctly sets the duration to the incoming Ensnare -->
<!-- - Fly-height is properly reset to zero when Mighty Leap (Midas' Band of Vigor) is interrupted by an Ensnare effect -->
<!-- - Made further adjustments to how the map groups units for enumeration. This addresses the bug with Winds of War (Warlord), Maelstrom & Thunderbolt (Druid), Death Wave (Warlock) and Sphinx's Chronowave mechanic that uses groups to track which units has been hit previously -->
<!-- - Updated the Warrior class intelligence level-ups to factor in how many levels are granted by a single-source of XP. (NB: This change does not retroactively address loads with the incorrect amount of intelligence) -->
<!-- - Multi-clicking UI buttons no longer registers multiple trigger events -->
<!-- - Selene (Hyperion) is now the damage source for her Meteor Shower ability (rather than Hyperion).  -->


<!-- Heroes -->
<!-- - Valor (Spartan Warrior) -->
<!-- ~ Now restores 75 / 150 / 250 / 500 / 750 / 1250 / 1875 / 2500 (+0.3 / 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6 / 0.7 / 0.8 / 0.9 / 1.0 Strength and 0.25 / 0.3 / 0.35 / 0.4 / 0.45 / 0.5 / 0.55 / 0.6 Spell Healing) over the duration -->
<!-- - Dispatch (Spartan Warrior) -->
<!-- - Reduced the damage of the bleed component to 100 / 200 / 350 / 550 / 850 / 1250 / 2000 / 3000 (+2.0 STR and +0.5 SD) from 200 / 400 / 700 / 1050 / 1700 / 2500 / 3750 / 5500 (+3.0 STR and +0.5 SD) -->
<!-- - Veteran's Set (Spartan Warrior) -->
<!-- - Reworded the effect -->
<!-- - Now increases both Strength ratios on Dispatch (SW) to 3.0 (from 2.0). -->

<!-- Sedah Scarecrow -->
<!-- Added timer length functionality to the DPS UI. This allows you to set an infinite, 30s, 60s, or 180s timer. Swapping between timer lengths resets your DPS numbers.  -->
<!-- A fixed length timer "memorises" the buffs you had active when the timer is started. (The infinite length timer retains the old buff tracking functionality). -->

<!-- Other -->
<!-- - Improved the language of Silenus' Talisman (Midas) and Midas' Pendant of Wisdom (Metalsmith Galen) to clarify that the effect doesn't proc for spell-enhanced auto-attacks if the target is already Enfeebled. -->
<!-- - Updated the tooltips for Throw Javelin (SW), Charge (SW), Cataclysm (GoN), Tremor (GoN), and Impale (Warlord) be consistent with the new colour-coded style.  -->
