# General
- *Backpack* have been renamed into *Familiar*
- Updated the boat replacement system to handle two concurrent boats. (This also means that the refund functionality has been removed)
- *Olympian Gemstone Shards* (Hyperion) now state the amount of charges in the generated save-code file
- *Thundering Hammer of Zeus* (Olympian Relic) and *Savage War Axe of Hephaestus* (Aeacus) are now simultaneously equippable under the current item uniqueness framework. See [Bug Fixes] for the reason why this occurred
- The *Fire Elemental* summon from the *Blaze o' Glory* item ability (Midas' Pendant of Wisdom) now has a mana pool which reflects it's duration (just like the *Fire Elemental* adds in the Midas fight)

<hr>

- The *Roar* ability on *Ares' Bloodthirsty Spear* (Olympian Relic) now features a unique icon to indicate that it doesn't stack with *Scroll of the Lesser Beast* and *Scroll of the Beast* (Alchemy)
- Added a section on item uniqueness to the TBR Mechanics F9 entry
- Reformatted *Aphrodite's Favour*'s (Goldsmith) item tooltip to be like *Midas' Ring of Vigor* (Metalsmith Galen)
- Defeating *Hades* now cleans up all *Ker* adds
- The level requirement for a bank has been reduced to 60. <small>(Previously 85)</small>

<hr>

- A number of UI buttons now happen on-click rather than on-release as a side effect of addressing an UI bug. See [Bug Fixes] for more details
- The Hero Selection heroes now register 0 damage from all sources
- Improved the language of *Silenus' Talisman* (Midas) and *Midas' Pendant of Wisdom* (Metalsmith Galen) to clarify that the effect doesn't proc for spell-enhanced auto-attacks if the target is already **Enfeebled**

# Sedah Scarecrow
<!-- Sedah Scarecrow (DPS Dummy) -->
<!-- The Sedah Scarecrow has been overhauled for DPS feedback purposes. It is no longer hostile by default and requires you to manually activate it by "purchasing" a token within 1000 units of it. Upon purchase, it becomes hostile and an user interface pops-up above the command card which details: -->
<!-- (1) Hero Information -->
<!-- (2) DPS calculations for Total, Physical, and Magical DPS. The calculation for DPS uses an average (mean) updated every second -->
<!-- (3) Misc. Statistics -->
<!-- (4) Ability to adjust the durability of the Sedah Scarecrow -->
<!-- (5) Buttons to configure the Sedah Scarecrow to Hades, Hyperion, and No Resistances durabilities -->
<!-- (6) Features a Close and Reset Timer button -->

<!-- The user interface tracks only tracks the damage you've dealt to it and it doesn't start timing until it takes damage from you. Lastly, the user interface automatically closes if you are no longer within 1000 units of it. -->

<!-- - The auto-close functionality when you're too far away from Sedah Scarecrow now runs as you open the UI -->

<!-- Added timer length functionality to the DPS UI. This allows you to set an infinite, 30s, 60s, or 180s timer. Swapping between timer lengths resets your DPS numbers.  -->
<!-- A fixed length timer "memorises" the buffs you had active when the timer is started. (The infinite length timer retains the old buff tracking functionality). -->


We've removed the Noirepyh Scarecrow as the functionality of having two scarecrows has been superseded.

# Bug Fixes
- *Transcendence* (Cleric) auto-attacks on the DPS dummy now properly calculates the heal
- *Adamantium Scythe* (Medusa) tooltip correctly states that it has a critical strike multiplier of 2.5
- *Assassinate* (Assassin), *Bum Rush* (Warlord) and *Charge* (Spartan Warrior) path-finding has been updated to mimic pre-1.39b3 behaviour and attempts to find better placement options than before. It also has a better failsafe of simply closing the distance if a pathable spot cannot be found. Furthermore, all three spells now share the same trait that Assassinate (and previously Charge) has where the blink doesn't occur if you're within 125 units of the target
- The item uniqueness check non longer prints an error message no longer prints error messages when a familiar picks up a unique item. This is because item uniqueness is only enforced for heroes
- Picking up *Savage War Axe of Hephaestus* (Aeacus) no longer triggers the *Thundering Hammer of Zeus* (Olympian Relic) item uniqueness error message when you already have *Hephaestus Thundering Axe* (Weaponsmith)

<hr>

- Picking up Warrior class exclusive items now states that *Khaos Champion* is a Warrior class hero
- *Midas' Pendant of Wisdom*'s (Metalsmith Galen) Enfeeble proc for spell damage is functional again
- Updated spawn regions in the *Tundra* and *Southern Highlands* to address mobs spawning on cliff faces
- The save/load system now correctly encrypts and decrypts the value stored for the *You picked the wrong house, fool* achievement
- Fixed typos in F9 help, *Gift of Wisdom* (Familiar Skill), and *Draught of the Phoenix*'s (Alchemist) crafting description

<hr>

- *Dancing Dagger* (Assassin) no longer bounces to structures
- Added a fail-safe for *Uranus*' item drops if neither the ground or air forms are currently in the arena
- Multi-clicking UI buttons no longer registers multiple trigger events
- *Selene* (Hyperion) is now the damage source for her Meteor Shower ability (rather than *Hyperion*)
- Updated the Warrior class intelligence level-ups to factor in how many levels are granted by a single-source of XP
  + **Not**e: This change does not retroactively address loads with the incorrect amount of intelligence)

<hr>

<!-- - Applying Ensnare to an already Ensnared unit now correctly sets the duration to the incoming Ensnare -->
<!-- - Fly-height is properly reset to zero when Mighty Leap (Midas' Band of Vigor) is interrupted by an Ensnare effect -->
<!-- - Made further adjustments to how the map groups units for enumeration. This addresses the bug with Winds of War (Warlord), Maelstrom & Thunderbolt (Druid), Death Wave (Warlock) and Sphinx's Chronowave mechanic that uses groups to track which units has been hit previously -->
