# New Achievements

1. *Summoning Game Done Quick*<br>Place all three *Summoning Stones* in the *Fountain of Light* within 12 minutes of game start
2. *I would walk 500 miles (again)*<br>Personally participate in defeating every Titan (including Hades) without teleporting once

> The following teleports invalidate the completion of this achievement: the town teleporters, *Town Portal* (Backpack), *Scroll of Town Portal* (Scrolls), *Boots of Marathon* (Armorsmith), *Phylas*, *Obelisk of Poseidon*, *Temple of Poseidon* and *Alcon*


# Boats

- *Trireme* renamed to *Boat*
- Hiring a *Boat* now replaces your previous boat (if applicable)
- *Boat*s have a collision size of 8. This hypothetically reduces boat bunching at a single location. (Previously a collision size of 0)
- *Boat*s now only transports a single hero unit. (Previously 8 non-mechanical units)
- The ability to *scuttle* a *Boat* has been removed in light of the new replacement framework
- *Shipyard* refreshes the stock of *Boats* at a rate of 1 second. (Previously 9 seconds)
- *Two boat skins* are now available and (tentatively) cost 1000 crafting materials:
  + The *Ferry skin* is unlocked by completing the *I would walk 500 miles (again)* achievement
  + The *Frigate skin* is unlocked by completing the *Summoning Game Done Quick* achievement
  
# Critical Strike Refactor
Critical Strike has been swapped to a coded system from base Wc3 mechanics. The following list describes what this change entails: 

- Critical Strike is now checked on-hit (before damage mitigation) rather than on-attack
- Each Critical Strike source is now rolled independently, and if there are multiple success, these multiplier stack additively. For example, if you a x2.5 and a x4.0 Critical Stike, your auto-attack has a x6.5 Critical Strike multiplier
- Any default Critical Strike animations no longer play when a Critical Strike is triggered
- *Black Arrow* and *Transcendence* enhanced auto-attacks no longer have their on-hit effects cancelled out due to a Critical Strike

We are also pre-emptively reducing the Critical Strike multipliers on items with this refactor:

- *Tooth of the Hallowed One* (Hallowed One): Critical Strike multiplier reduced to 2.5 (from 3.0)
- *Adamantium Lance* (Metalsmith Arcadios): Critical Strike multiplier reduced to 2.5 (from 3.0)
- *Wraithblade* (Champion's Armory): Critical Strike multiplier reduced to 2.5 (from 3.0)
- *Sword of Destruction* (Relic): Critical Strike multiplier reduced to 3.5 (from 4.0)
- *Blazing Sword of Helios* (Olympian Relic): Critical Strike multiplier reduced to 4.0 (from 4.5)
  
# Hyperion
  
- *Theia*'s Rejuvenation (and Frost Armor on *Hyperion* when skipping *Theia*) A.I. now triggers when any of the family is damaged (previously auto-attacks)
- *Hyperion*'s and the family's turn rate has been increased to 0.2 (previously 0.1)
- Buffed *Hyperion*'s and the family's auto-attacks and armor values to account for the addition of *Backpack Skills* in `1.39b`:
  + *Hyperion* ~ Damage: 116000 → 120000; Armor: 102 → 130
  + *Theia* ~ Base Damage: 76000 → 78625; Armor: 40 → 49
  + *Selene* ~ Base Damage: 33500 → 34655; Armor: 67 → 83
  + *Helios* ~ Base Damage: 53000 → 54830; Armor: 77 → 96
  + *Eos* ~ Base Damage: 28250 → 29225; Armor: 57 → 70
  + *Noirepyh Scarecrow* ~ Armor: 102 → 130

# Bug Fixes

- *Tooth of the Hallowed One* (Hallowed One) now adheres to the item uniqueness rule
- Adjusted a spawn/patrol zone within the *Eastern Highlands* to not intentionally clip the cliff that surrounds Gaea's arena
- *Draught of the Phoenix*'s (Alchemist) crafting tooltip now reflects the updated effect introduced in `1.39a`
- *Veteran's Regalia* (Spartan Warrior) no longer grants the unlisted Evasion ability
- *Ice Ring*'s (Ice Giant) cast FX is reverted back to `1.39a2`'s cast FX

---

- *Ensnare* now uses a pool of dummy casters to prevent a rare bug, where flying enemies (only *Uranus* as of `1.39b2`) can teleport across the map to where another generic debuff was cast. 
- *Requiem* (Khaos Champion) now registers a duration increase when either *Neleus* or *Pelias* are slain
- *Backpack Skin* shadows are now rendered properly (as seen in *Athens*). *NB: The wisp skin does not have a shadow*
- Removed an erroneous space in *Tome of Stat Increase +8*'s (Books) tooltip
- *Pray*'s (Temple Guardian) base object now shows the mana cost

---

- Both `-repick` and creating a new character no longer sets the backpack skill points for the player "below" you to 7 (for the former) and to 6 (for the latter)
- *Sadism* (Warlock) no longer generates its consumption FX while you're inside a boat
- *Walk in the Shadows* (Assassin) no longer attempts to continuously applies it damage buff while you're inside a boat
- Added a condition to *Theia*'s AI for casting *Rejuvenation* and *Frost Armor*. This condition prevents her from casting either spell if she is already attempting to
- Fixed a rare bug where resetting the *Manslayer* and *Lightbane* (Minotaur Burrows) doesn't respawn both of them

---

- *A Rare Specimen* (Damien), *Gone with the Wind* (Attis), and *History's Teachings* (Dolios) are now registered with the *Quest Helper* (Backpack)
- `-save` no longer sets the ownership of unique crafting components to the player that triggered the command
- Updated how all hero spells group targets
- *Grave Seize* (Khaos Champion) tracks when the *Stun* debuff wears off rather than when the *Stun Immunity* buff to apply the *Taunt* debuff. This hypothetically addresses the bug where *Grave Seize* can pull another player hero for infinite time after a duel concludes
- The *Burning* debuff (*Midas* and *Blaze o' Glory*) is updated to no longer reset the tick-rate. This addresses the inconsistent damage dealt to stationary targetse

---

- The crafting tooltip for *Midas' Pendant of Wisdom* (Metalsmith Galen) now mirrors the item description
- Fixed the typos present in *Hyperion*'s messages when he summons either *Helios* or *Theia* first
- Boss kills no longer grant XP via default Warcraft 3 mechanics. To compensate for this, the XP modifier for bosses was increased to 25 (from 6)

# Other

- *Tome of Stat Increase +8* (Books) grants all eight stats at once. (Previously grants them once at a time)
- *Fire of Apollo* (Temple Guardian): Updated so it's DoT component deals 4 ticks per second (from 1 tick per second)
- Backpack skins now refund their cost if you rebuy a backpack skin you already have active
- The *Taunt* debuff now dispels if the caster and target are no longer enemies
- *Blaze o' Glory*'s (Midas' Pendant of Wisdom) Fire Elemental summon now lasts for 10 seconds (down from 30 seconds). The summon's duration is also now explicitly stated in the tooltip

---

- *Draught of Destruction, Heaven and Life* (Alchemy) have their crafting material cost increased to 2500 (previously 500)
- The following interaction hotkeys are now properly exposed: *Escort the Pack Beast* (Cavalorn); *Read aloud from the Crumbling Tome* (Caverns of Dread); *Help Neleus* (Neleus); *Help Pelias* (Pelias); *Escort Greyn* (Greyn); *Interact* (Crystal Lamp); and *Open the Gate* (Eretria)
- *Hyperion*'s Thunder Bolt now queues a stand animation after the spell animation instead of entering a freeze frame

---

- *Ares Bloodthirsty Spear* (Olympian Relic)
- *Shadow Blade* (Relic)
- *Boot of Hermes* (Makarios - Caverns of Dread)
- *The Winged God's Blessed Boots* (Metalsmith Galen)
- *Boots of Marathon* (Armorsmith)
- *Myrmidon Scale* (Rare Drop)
